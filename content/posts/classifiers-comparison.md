## Description
The purpose of the project is to compare the performance of different ensemble methods (Bagging and AdaBoost) using various base classifiers across multiple datasets. It uses cross-validation to evaluate model accuracy, conducts statistical tests to assess the significance of performance differences, ranks the classifiers, and saves the results for further analysis.

## Dependent features
 - ensemble technique (Bagging or AdaBoost)
 - classifier type (CART, MLP, GNB)
 - number of classifiers
